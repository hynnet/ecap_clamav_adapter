This eCAP adapter module checks HTTP request and response bodies using the
ClamAV antivirus library and denies access to messages with detected viruses.

Configuration via host application (e.g., squid.conf in Squid v3.2 or later):

    on_error=ACTION  What to do with the message being scanned if scan fails.
                     Valid actions are block and allow. Default is allow.

    staging_dir=PATTERN  Where to put files for libclamav analysis. Libclamav
                         API requires us to store complete message bodies into
                         files before the analysis can start.
                         The specified pattern can be a directory name ending
                         with a slash or a filename prefix. If the pattern
                         does not end with an "X", The adapter appends
                         "XXXXXX" to allow for random file names.  It may be a
                         good idea to use a RAM-based filesystem for the
                         staging directory to speedup I/O. The default is
                         /tmp/eclamavXXXXXX.

    huge_size=SIZE  Message bodies of at least this size are allowed without
                    analysis. They are still accumulated if the body size is
                    unknown at the transaction start. Keep in mind that
                    libclamav has various hidden size limits of its own but
                    there is no documented API to change those.
                    If set to "none", no limit is imposed. Other valid values
                    are unsigned positive integers representing the number of
                    bytes in the smallest huge message. The default is "none".
