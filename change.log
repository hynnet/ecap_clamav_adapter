v0.2.1
2011/04/06

	- Fixed build failure due to missing config.h #include file.


v0.2.0
2011/03/15

	- Support, require, and check for libecap v0.2.

	- Supply detected virus ID to the host application via the eCAP
	  X-Virus-ID meta-header. The host may log the supplied virus ID with
	  other transaction details or perform other host-specific
	  notification actions.

	- Made unknown service options a fatal configuration error as opposed
	  to just a warning.

	- Added debug=full|none ClamAV service option to enable debugging.
	  This feature is based on undocumented cl_debug() ClamAV API and
	  suffers from that API limitations: If enabled for one service, all
	  services will be debugged, and debugging can no longer be turned
	  off. More work is needed (using unstable ClamAV debugging callback
	  interfaces) to make debugging usable beyond lab tests.

	- Use GPL v2, the minimally restrictive license allowed by libclamav.
